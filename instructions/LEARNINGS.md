## Solutions

### MCP Integration

- Successfully integrated Multi-Context Processing with Supabase
- Implemented vector search for relevant document retrieval
- Enhanced chat responses with contextual information
- Updated to latest Claude model for improved responses

### Vector Search

- Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for embeddings
- Implemented match_documents function in Supabase
- Configured relevance thresholds for better matches
- Added error handling for embedding creation

### Chat Interface

- Enhanced AnthropicClient with MCP capabilities
- Added context inclusion in chat messages
- Improved error handling and response formatting
- Implemented chat history tracking

### File Upload Implementation

- Used FileReader API for handling file uploads
- Implemented base64 encoding for images
- Added type declarations for message attachments
- Used TypeScript declaration merging for extending types

## Patterns

### State Management

- Using React hooks for local state
- Implementing reducers for complex state
- Using context for shared state

### Error Handling

- Consistent error response format
- Type-safe error handling
- Proper error messages and logging

### Component Design

- Client/Server component separation
- Reusable base components
- Consistent styling patterns

### Message Metadata Extension

```typescript
interface FileAttachment {
  type: "image" | "text";
  content: string;
  name: string;
}

declare module "@/types/chat" {
  interface MessageMetadata {
    attachments?: FileAttachment[];
  }
}
```

### File Processing Pattern

```typescript
const fileToBase64 = (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result as string);
    reader.onerror = (error) => reject(error);
  });
};
```

## Performance Insights

- Chat interface renders efficiently
- API routes handle errors gracefully
- Tool execution framework in place
- Base64 encoding increases payload size
- Consider implementing file compression
- May need to add file size limits
- Consider chunked upload for large files
